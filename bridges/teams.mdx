<Tip>
  Microsoft Teams is a huge pain to use and communicate with customers through.
  Our current recommendation is to talk to customers over email instead of Teams
  if you can help it for now. If you insist otherwise, we have an option for
  you, but be warned, it will require a heavy lift for implementation.
</Tip>

The Slack-Teams Bridge allows you to mirror messages from a Teams Channel to a
Slack channel in your own workspace, and vice versa. This feature reduces the
pain of having to use Teams to talk to customers that don't use Slack
internally.

Threaded and non-threaded conversations are supported.

## Limitations

### DMs

We do not currently track DMs that you may be sent through Teams.

### Channel Setup

Group chats and channels are supported, but only if you created them. Otherwise,
your customer is the only one that can add Pylon into the channel or chat.

If you already have a chat that the customer created, you must move the
conversation to a chat or channel that you've initiated.

### Reactions

Reactions will be posted in a way similar to if you react to a text message in a
chat between an Android and iPhone (example below). This is because the emoji
used in Teams are not standard like Slack's.

```
Marty reacted ":+1:" to "Message"
```

### Files

Files and attachments are currently not supported.

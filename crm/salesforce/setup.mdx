## Features

### Activity Sync

Everyday, Pylon scans your customer channels for conversations that were had.
For every conversation, we use AI to summarize the details, and sync the summary
to the relevant `Account` in your CRM.

### Contact Sync

When someone new joins a prospect or customer channel, we add that contact to
your CRM and link it to the relevant `Account`.

### Channel Creation from Salesforce

You can greatly simplify Slack channel creation using our Salesforce widget.
Click `Create Slack Channel` from Salesforce, name the channel, and the
following will automatically happen:

1. Channel will be created and named
2. All `Opportunity` `Contact Roles` will be invited to join the channel
3. Pylon will be enabled within the channel
4. `Invitees` from the customer side will be sent a `Welcome Message` once they
   join the channel

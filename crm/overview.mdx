We built this add-on because our customers had a huge gap of customer data in
their CRM. The same expectations of fluid data flow from emails and video calls
to their CRM did not exist for their Slack conversations and interactions.

We set out to fix this by focusing on:

<CardGroup cols={1}>
  <Card title="Conversations" icon="comments" color="#0285c7">
    Every conversation in email or a video call would've been synced to your CRM
    as an Activity. Now those are chats happening in your shared Slack channel
    and are not tracked.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Contacts" icon="users" color="#ea5a0c">
    Every contact that you email or have a calendar meeting with would've been
    synced as a Contact and Contact Role. Now they get added into your Slack
    channel and don't get tracked.

    Every email tool is able to work off of CRM logic, Pylon should be no
    different.

## Reasons to Consider the CRM Sync

### #1 Your CRM is your Source of Truth

If your Sales or Customer Success team uses your CRM as a place to have
visibility on deals, and your conversations are happening in Slack, you have a
huge gap.

Your options are:

- Ask reps to mannually log conversations ðŸ‘Ž
- Have missing data in your CRM ðŸ“­
- Let Pylon log all conversations automatically âœ…

Here's a table with conservative estimates of how much time your team would need
to spend keeping your CRM up to date with Slack Conversations. This assumes
summarizing a conversation and logging it in your CRM will take 5 minutes.

| Reps | Customer Conversations in Slack / Day | Time Spent Logging Data / Month |
| ---- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| 1    | 5                                     | 8hrs                            |
| 5    | 25                                    | 40hrs                           |
| 10   | 50                                    | 80hrs                           |
| 20   | 100                                   | 160hrs                          |

### #2 You have Workflows Powered by CRM Data

If your Sales, RevOps, or Customer Success teams leverage `Activity` data, not
including Slack conversations means those workflows won't work.

<Tip>
  Let's say you have 1 conversation per week per account on average. For 100
  accounts your CRM is missing 5,200 activities per year.
</Tip>

Common workflows that break without `Activity` data:

- Pipeline Cleaning
- Revenue Forecasting
- Reminders to Checkin after Periods of No Activity
- Customer Health Calculations to Predict Churn
- Syncing Data to Customer Success Tool

### #3 You want your CRM Data Powering Pylon

When you connect your CRM to Pylon, existing features become much more powerful.

In particular:

1. Sending Broadcasts to customers who have certain attributes
2. Filter Analytics based on CRM Attributes

## Why a CRM Sync is Needed

### To Keep your CRM Relevant

Sales and Customer Success teams in partifular rely on the CRM as the source of truth for their customer and prospect data including `Activities`, `Contacts`, and general `Attributes`.

Given that many (if not most) of your email and many calls have moved to Slack, your
CRM is is likely missing a huge number data points that used to otherwise get captured by
your CRM.

<Tip>
  Let's say you have 1 conversation per week per account on average. For 100
  accounts your CRM is missing 4,800 activities per year.
</Tip>

So, without a proper CRM sync, If you treat the CRM as your source of truth, it means you're spending hundreds of hours

### To Supercharge Pylon

The two data

  <Card title="Conversations" icon="comments" color="#0285c7">
    Every conversation in email or a video call would've been synced to your CRM
    as an Activity. Now those are chats happening in your shared Slack channel
    and are not tracked.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Contacts" icon="users" color="#ea5a0c">
    Every contact that you email or have a calendar meeting with would've been
    synced as a Contact and Contact Role. Now they get added into your Slack
    channel by their team members and don't get tracked.

### So what?

## What does it do?

Our CRM syncs and creates the following data across systems:

1. Activity Sync
2. Contact Sync
3. Attribute Sync

### Activity Sync

Most companies intend to keep their CRM as the source of truth for customer data. This is especially relevant for Sales and Customer Success teams.

<Tip>
  If you find yourself copy-pasting the same message over and over into many
  channels at a time, you should probably be sending a Broadcast instead.
</Tip>

### Use Cases

    need additional help.

## Broadcasts vs Email

The difference between sending a message in Slack vs Email is that Slack is where your customers talk with their own team. As a result, all messages sent over Slack get seen.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="15-30% Engagement Rate" icon="paper-plane-top" color="#ea5a0c">
    For messages sent over Slack.
  </Card>
  <Card title="2-4% Engagement Rate" icon="envelope" color="#0285c7">
    For messages sent over Email.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

This power comes with great responsibility. So make sure your messages are relevant to your Broadcast recipients.

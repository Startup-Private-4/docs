AI Support automatically suggests knowledge base articles based on a customer
questions. It leverages the recent and seemingly magical advances in generative
AI to match customer questions with what you've already written up in your
documentation.

## Expectation Setting

If you're using Pylon, you likely have dedicated support or success teams
managing your most important relationships in your customer Slack channels.
Unlike the rapid-fire support of something like an E-Commerce business, B2B
auto-responses are much more important to get right so here are the principles
by which we protect aim to protect those relationships when enabling AI:

1. If the AI has low confidence in answering a question, lean towards not
   responding
2. While we calibrate AI Support, it will only recommend articles, never come up
   with the solution text itself

## Supported Knowledge Bases

We built AI Support to be able to crawl any knowledgebase in the browser. That
means regardless of where your documentation sits, we'll be able to work with
it.

## How it Works

When a customer asks a question that gets turned into a support ticket, if AI
Support has high confidence that the documentation has the solution, it will
post the suggested documentation links.

The customer or you can then mark whether the suggested documentation solved the
problem or not.

Results on whether it resolved the issue are not yet surfaced in the UI, but
we'll send you that data upon request.

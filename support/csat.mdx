<Info>
  CSAT is currently only available for Zendesk. Reach out to us if you'd like it
  enabled in a different support tool.
</Info>

You can collect CSAT scores directly in your Slack thread once a support ticket
is closed.

The score is only visible to the customer and will be synced back to Zendesk.

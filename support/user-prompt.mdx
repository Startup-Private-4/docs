You can enable customers to self-serve into support workflows with the support
user prompt.

If enabled, when a customer sends a message that looks like a support question,
we'll prompt them to self-serve into creating a support ticket automatically.
The message they see can be customized on the
[Workflows Page](https://app.usepylon.com/workflows).

This message is only visible to the question asker and balances ongoing
education with minimal intrusion.

<Tip>
  If you have a seperate Support and Customer Success teams, you should be using
  the support integration.
</Tip>

The support integration allows your team and/or customers to initiate support
tickets from Slack, that bidirectionally sync with an external support tool like
Zendesk.

Unlike a [Conversational Ticket](/ticketing/overview), a support ticket is
synced to an external support system like Zendesk. Support tickets are visible
in Slack to the customer with a status.

When the support team gets a new ticket synced to their support tool, they can
respond without leaving their tool. That response will sync directly back to the
Slack channel where the ticket was opened.

Here's why this is powerful:

    If you're a CSM or Account Managers wasting time shuffling messages between
    a customer and support, you can use the support integration to seamlessly
    handoff support questions to the support team, directly from Slack.

    Through the support integration, all support questions from Slack will sync
    to your Support Tool. This allows you to leverage all existing reporting and
    workflows you have setup for non-Slack support.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Allow Customers to stay in Slack" icon="hashtag">
    Support questions created through the Support Integration keep back and
    forth on support questions in Slack. This gives full visibility to the CSM
    or Account Manager on status in Slack.

## Opening a Ticket

### Customer Prompt

When a customer asks a message in Slack that looks like a support question, they
can be prompted to optionally open a support ticket. Enable this setting and
customize the message they see on the
[Workflows Page](https://app.usepylon.com/workflows).

### Ticket Emoji

You can react to any message or thread with the ðŸŽ« emoji to create a ticket.

<Frame>

</Frame>

### Tag Support

The customer can tag `@Your Company Support` at anytime to kickoff a support
ticket.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/tag-support.png" />
</Frame>

### Floating Bar

The floating bar is a message that stays "pinned" to the bottom of a channel. It
stays pinned by constantly reposting itself at the bottom of the channel when
new messages are sent in the channel.

The bar itself has a button that opens a modal with a form to kickoff a support
ticket. These inputs can be mapped to fields in your support system.

This method of ticketing is the most forceful for your customer, as they will be
reminded to open a support ticket with each message they send in the channel.

## Responding from a Support Tool

When a support ticket is created, a synced ticket is created in your support
system.

Messages posted in that support thread in Slack will be synced to your support
system ticket, and vice versa.

</Frame>

<Tip>
  You can enable more granular ticket data such as a ticket link and ticket ID
  to be visible in Slack.
</Tip>

## Closing a Ticket

Support ticket status is synced between your support system and Slack.

Either your team or the customer can click the `Close Issue` button in Slack or
the support team can close the ticket from the support tool.

State will be reflected in both systems.

## Additional Settings

### Collect Custom Field

You can collect additional field information to sync to your support system.

This can be a dropdown or text input.

The most common use case is collecting a `Severity` field as shown below.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/custom-field.png" />
</Frame>

### Additional Ticket Message

You can have an additional message post in Slack when new messages are opened.

Common use cases include:

- Notifying customers that your company is at an offsite
- Special Holiday Hours (e.g. Winter Holiday)
- Asking for a free-form field (e.g. Please include your Model ID)

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/additional-ticket.png" />
</Frame>

### Support Hours

You can set custom support hours so that if a customer opens a support ticket
outside of those hours, a custom message will be posted.

  <img src="/images/support-settings.png" />

</Frame>

### Escalation

<Tip>
  We recommend you setup escalation not by using this method, but by collecting
  a severity on ticket open, and triggering escalation from your support system
  based on the selection.
</Tip>

If a message is sent outside of support hours you can enable an `Escalate`
button to be included with the message. If the button is clicked, a message will
be sent to a pre-selected escalation channel.

## View Support Tickets in Slack

Anyone from your team can go into a customer channel and immediately get
visibility into support tickets for the customer by typing `/pylon`.

Three details including first message, `Status`, and link to external system are
included.

- ðŸŽ« indicates the ticket is open
- âœ… indicates the ticket is closed
